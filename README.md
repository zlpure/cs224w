## My Solution to Assignments of CS224w
This is my solution to three assignments of CS224w.<br>
[CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/) (Stanford / Fall 2019) is
an interesting class, which teaches you how to perform machine learning algorithms with graphs.
As we all konw, networks are a fundamental tool for modeling complex social, technological, and biological systems.  And we can learn the folloing content in this course: 

- How to represent networks using large-scale datasets?
- How to analyse massive networks which provide several computational, algorithmic, and modeling challenges?
- How to use machine learning techniques and data mining tools apt to study their underlying network structure and interconnections?

**Note:** If you consult my source codes that you may want to incorporate into your algorithm or system, you should clearly cite references in your codes.
